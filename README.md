# pa-aa-cookiecutter

This cookiecutter can be used to create a new repository for an OCHA Anticipatory Action pilot. Using this cookiecutter will help to standardize the structure of an analysis for a pilot and will take care of generating boilerplate content such as a basic README and `.Rmd` docs. 

To use this cookiecutter, first install `cookiecutter`:

```
pip install cookiecutter
```

Then, generate a template from this repo:

```
cookiecutter https://github.com/OCHA-DAP/pa-aa-cookiecutter
```
